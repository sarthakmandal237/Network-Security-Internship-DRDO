Network Security Internship at SAG Lab, DRDO New Delhi
Overview
This repository contains the work completed during the Network Security Internship at the Scientific Analysis Group (SAG) Lab, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), New Delhi. The internship provided hands-on experience in various network security protocols, simulations, and vulnerability assessments, contributing to the defense technology sector.

Key Learnings and Projects
1. OSI Model and Network Security
OSI Model
Studied the 7-layer OSI model, focusing on:
Understanding the functionalities and importance of each layer in networking.
Security protocols across different layers, with emphasis on Layer 3 (Network Layer), Layer 4 (Transport Layer), and Layer 7 (Application Layer).
2. SSL and TLS Protocols
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
Implemented SSL to establish secure and encrypted communication links between clients and servers.

Transport Layer Security (TLS)
Advanced the security layer by implementing TLS protocols, enhancing encryption standards to protect data integrity and confidentiality.

3. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm
Implemented the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to securely exchange cryptographic keys over unsecured networks.
Worked on key management and secure transmission to ensure the protection of sensitive data.
4. Nmap and Network Scanning
Nmap (Network Mapper)
Performed vulnerability assessments using Nmap to:
Map out network structures.
Identify open ports and services.
Analyze potential vulnerabilities through TCP, UDP, and SYN scans.
Nmap Working Protocol
Studied how Nmap operates across different network layers, leveraging its advanced features for deep security scans.
5. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
Explored security challenges in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN):
Addressed communication security.
Mitigated threats like eavesdropping, data tampering, and routing attacks in wireless sensor environments.
6. Wired Network Simulations
Static Routing Simulation
Configured and simulated a network with four routers using Static Routing in Cisco Packet Tracer, ensuring efficient routing paths.

Dynamic Routing Simulation (RIP Protocol)
Implemented Routing Information Protocol (RIP) in Cisco Packet Tracer, automating the exchange of routing information and improving network efficiency.

VLAN Configuration
Set up VLANs using CLI commands in Cisco Packet Tracer to optimize network management and segment networks for enhanced security and performance.

7. Wireless Network Simulations
Wireless Network Topology
Simulated wireless network topologies, focusing on configuring devices, establishing communication protocols, and analyzing network performance.

Wormhole Attack Simulation
Simulated a Wormhole Attack in wireless networks to understand its effects on data transmission and develop countermeasures.

Blackhole Attack Simulation
Simulated a Blackhole Attack, a network-layer attack that drops all data packets, and studied mitigation strategies for securing wireless networks.

Certification
Successfully completed the internship and earned a certification from DRDO, marking a significant step toward building a strong foundation in network security.

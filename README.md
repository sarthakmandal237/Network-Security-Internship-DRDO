Internship at DRDO SAG Lab - Network Security

I had the incredible opportunity to complete an internship at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), SAG Lab, New Delhi, focusing on Network Security. This experience provided me with practical knowledge in securing network infrastructures and mitigating potential threats. Below is a summary of the key concepts and skills I gained during my internship:

Key Learnings

1. OSI Model Layers

In-depth understanding of the OSI Model, including all 7 layers and their role in network communication.


2. SSL/TLS Protocols

Implemented Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to enhance network security.

Gained insights into their importance in ensuring secure communication over networks.


3. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm

Studied and understood the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm used for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.


4. Nmap (Network Mapper)

Conducted network scanning using Nmap to identify open ports and detect vulnerabilities in wired and wireless networks.

Learned the inner workings of the Nmap protocol and its role in vulnerability assessment.


5. Wired Network Simulations

Performed various wired network simulations using Cisco Packet Tracer, including:

Static Routing with Four Routers.

Dynamic Routing using Routing Information Protocol (RIP).

VLAN Configuration using CLI commands.



6. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

Gained an understanding of Wireless Sensor Networks and their importance in secure communication.


7. Wireless Network Simulations

Worked on wireless network simulations involving:

Creating Wireless Network Topologies.

Simulating Wormhole Attack.

Simulating Blackhole Attack.
